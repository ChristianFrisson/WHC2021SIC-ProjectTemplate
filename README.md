## Abstract

<!-- Summarize your project: for now copy the short pitch from your proposal -->

## Introduction

<!-- Explain your project: for now copy the 300-word description from your proposal -->

### Documentation

#### Hardware

<!-- Describe your hardware components -->

##### Sensors wiring

<!-- Feel free to remove or adapt the following explanation once you have understood its potential implications for your project. -->

We use the SparkFun Qwiic system to rapidly and remotely prototype sensors without much soldering. Qwiic uses the I2C communication protocol with addresses assigned per board model.
Our Qwiic-based architectures may require:
- 1 Qwiic MUX I2C multiplexer board per group identical sensor/board model (example: needed by 2 flex finger boards in the figures below)
- 1 Qwiic ADC board per group of 4 sensors that are not implemented as Qwiic boards (example: needed by 4 FSRs sensors in the figures below)

<!-- Adapt this sensor architecture, covering all possible sensors accross all teams, to your team. -->
